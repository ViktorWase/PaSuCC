It runs on Matlab and uses an evolutionary algorithm that optimizes fitness of the keys. The fitness is a measure of how well the frequency of the letters and letter pairs of the plaintext matches that of english.\r\n\r\nThe code includes the three Beale ciphers, but any substitution cipher could be included.\r\n\r\nNote that it takes about an hour for the code to run one attack, and it will require multiple trials to crack the cipher.\r\n\r\n### License\r\nThe P.A.SU.C.C. code is a Github project registered under the Apache License 2.0.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nP.A.SU.C.C. was created by Viktor Wase (@ViktorWase).
